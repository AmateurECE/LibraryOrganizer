# LibraryOrganizer
This is a Perl script I'm wrote to organize my music library. The file sort.pl provides full disclosure of the format in which the files are arranged. BackupManif(...) is an example of an output file from this program. The file move.pl moves the sorted directories into a repository where they can be further processed. Sortmusic is a Unix shell script that runs both sort and move with predefined parameters. I decided to keep them separate so that sort.pl can be used by itself as a tool. The file test.pl tests the performance of the program and prints the results to an ErrorTest(...) file. An example is shown.
